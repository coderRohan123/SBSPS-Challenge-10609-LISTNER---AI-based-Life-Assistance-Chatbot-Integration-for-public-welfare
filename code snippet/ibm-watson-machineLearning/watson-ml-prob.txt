--Ibm watson machine learning service was used  to train the emotion detection model
  which is further used in our flask app

--We were deploying our model using ibm cloud, but this month's cpu cycle counts limit exceeded
  we tried a bunch of other methods but all went in vain (mainly because most of the services like
  cloud foundary, python-flask app etc were deprecated)

--Thus we just rendered our model and the web app on google colab only.
